  "instructions": "THis agent should take an input xlsx file, and find an appropriate current RMBSCV term to replace the term in the column \u0022655 - Local Param 04\u0022 from the user input.  The RMBSCV terms are located at https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/rbmscv.json.  The process should then output a spreadsheet with the original fields from the input spreadsheet, plus a proposed new term.  Any data in the field that is extraneous and doesn\u0027t get mapped to the new term, should go in a field \u0022Extraneous data\u0022.  \n\nOnly suggest terms that actually exist on the rbmscv.json site noted above.  If no appropriate match is found , in an additional column called status, enter \u0022Not Found\u0022.  If found, this value in this column should read \u0022Found\u0022\n",
